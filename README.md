## Concepts Demonstrated

* The first commit shows a freshly generated NestJs project (as of 1/27/2024)
* The second commit demonstrates the addition of:
  * An event module
  * An event entity translated from
    [the sequelize event model use for infinite industries](https://github.com/infinite-industries/infinite/blob/b024eb278a9200c42c15d91a039b9a851e0fafb6/api-server/src/events/models/event.model.ts)
  * A service that leverages the entity
  * A controller that uses the service
* The third commit demonstrates the additions of migrations:
  * The migrations make use of typescript for configuration
  * The configuration is shared between the nest application and the migration cli, this is an improvement over how
    Sequelize was configured
